1. SAP scores:aggregation propensity
N. Chennamsetty, V. Voynov, V. Kayser, B. Helk, B.L. Trout Prediction of aggregation prone regions of therapeutic proteins J. Phys. Chem. B, 114 (2010), pp. 6614-6624

#hydrophobicity:Hydrophobicity can relate to aggregation propensity, solubility, viscosity, self-interaction, and
protein stability, making it useful to predict potential downstream risks. Aggregation of antibody
therapeutics can lead to precipitation and shortened storage period of drugs before administration,
while aggregation in vivo can increase the immunogenicity of the drug. To predict the solubility and aggregation propensity of protein, several prediction tools have
been developed, 
1.SOLart
2. CamSol:solubility of sequences

#Immunogenicity
1. Immune epitope database analysis resource (IEDB-AR) is a comprehensive website that provides several computational tools focused
on the prediction and analysis of B and T cell epitopes
2. Biophi: Merke and Bitton's group: Sapiens, transformer enconder-based language model
3. HuMab: Deane group, train on OAS 2Billion sequences, random forest model

#Pharmacokinetic clearance
Pharmacokinetic (PK) clearance determines the half-life of an antibody and therefore determines
how long an antibody drug can remain in the body after administration. Isoelectric point (pI), viscosity, immunogenicity, non-specificity, aggregation, and stability are factors related to clinical PK
clearance rate
